# Moist Static Energy (MSE)

# The atmospheric circulation depends on poorly understood interactions between the tropical atmospheric boundary layer (BL) and convection. The surface moist static energy (MSE) source of evaporation to the tropical marine BL is balanced by upward MSE flux at the BL top that is the source for deep convection. Variable entrainment and downdraft MSE fluxes between the BL and convective clouds must both be considered for modeling the climate.
